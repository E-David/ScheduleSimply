#ScheduleSimply

##Getting started
 - Schedule tasks using your Google Calendar. First sign in and give the app permissions to view your calendar. This allows the app to 1. filter out times you are busy and 2. schedule events directly onto your calendar.
 - Make your to-do list of tasks. A name and length must be provided to successfully add a task.
 - To prevent overscheduling or feeling overwhelmed from a huge task list, the app automatically detects how long your bundle of tasks will take. It will ask to schedule the tasks once this limit has been reached.
 - Alternatively, you may press the schedule button at the top at any time to schedule any length of tasks immediately.
 - Once scheduled, your tasks will be listed as the calendar event name on your Google calendar. Now, any Google notifications you have will apply, reminding you when you tasked yourself to complete these tasks. Good luck!
 - Full-stack app allows users to access their tasks accross sessions and platforms. Tasks added will persist if user logs in on different devices
